    keyMatchup: "Darius Garland against Detroit's backcourt defense is the series' central chess match, as the Cavaliers' point guard averaged over 20 points and 6 assists per game this season and must be contained to slow Cleveland's pace-and-space attack.",
    narrative: "Detroit, despite holding the top seed, showed vulnerability against Cleveland's deep, versatile roster in Game 1 and must find answers for the Cavaliers' multi-layered offensive system that features elite shooting, rim pressure, and secondary playmaking. The Pistons' youth and physicality give them a puncher's chance, but they must sharpen their defensive rotations and limit second-chance opportunities that Cleveland exploited in the opener. If Cade Cunningham cannot impose his will as a two-way force and force the Cavaliers into uncomfortable half-court possessions, Detroit's season may slip away faster than their top seed suggests it should.",

    playoffHistory: "These franchises have met multiple times in the postseason, most memorably in the bruising late-1990s battles won by New York, giving the Knicks a psychological and historical edge in high-stakes series.",
    keyMatchup: "Jalen Brunson against Philadelphia's primary ball-handlers is the series' fulcrum — Brunson averaged over 29 points per game in the 2024 playoffs and must be contained or the 76ers have no viable path to advancing.",
    narrative: "For Philadelphia to steal this series without Joel Embiid at full capacity, Tyrese Maxey must ascend to a level beyond anything he has sustained over a full playoff series, while the role players around him need to shoot well above their averages to compensate for the talent gap. The Knicks are vulnerable when their bench scoring dries up and opponents push pace, so Philadelphia's best hope is turning this into a chaotic, up-tempo street fight rather than the half-court grind New York prefers. If the 76ers split the Garden games and take care of home court, a short series becomes conceivable — but history, health, and momentum all favor New York closing this out in five.",

    keyMatchup: "Shai Gilgeous-Alexander (30+ PPG scorer this season) against LeBron James is the series' marquee individual battle, with SGA's relentless downhill drives testing a 40-year-old LeBron's willingness to expend defensive energy on the perimeter while still shouldering offensive load on the other end.",
    narrative: "For the Lakers to steal this series, LeBron James needs to weaponize his playoff IQ to manufacture mismatches that neutralize OKC's suffocating defensive scheme — if AD can dominate the paint and force the Thunder into half-court situations, LA has a puncher's chance. OKC's youth could theoretically be a vulnerability in a physical, grinding series, but the Thunder looked anything but rattled in Game 1, and their depth advantage makes every Lakers mistake exponentially more costly as the series progresses.",

    playoffHistory: "These franchises have no significant shared playoff history, making this a largely fresh postseason rivalry.",
    keyMatchup: "Victor Wembanyama against Karl-Anthony Towns' replacement frontcourt is the series' central chess match, with Wembanyama averaging over 24 points, 10 rebounds, and 3.6 blocks per game this season and commanding the paint on both ends.",
    narrative: "Minnesota enters as the underdog partly by seed but mostly because no team has yet cracked the code on containing Wembanyama in a seven-game format; for the Wolves to steal this series, Anthony Edwards must be the singular offensive force he's capable of while the defense finds a way to limit Wembanyama's pick-and-roll damage without fouling into oblivion. San Antonio is vulnerable if its young supporting cast tightens up under playoff pressure and Minnesota's length disrupts the ball movement that makes the Spurs' system hum. The Wolves took Game 1's loss on the chin, but Edwards' response in Game 2 will signal whether this is a series or a sweep.",
